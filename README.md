# Kanopi

Record, explore, analyze, discover.

Targeting a new sweet spot between

## Rationale

Accelerating change is not all we deal with. Such change increases the
complexity of our world as we lack both the tools and the time to rapidly
scalably simplify the new. Kanopi is an attempt to fight complexity at
scale with the only system that works at scale: learning.

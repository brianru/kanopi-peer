This directory contains checklists explaining how to adapt Kanopi to a
new feature or requirement.

Checklists should be available for all intended and well-structured
means of changing the functionality of Kanopi. This does not mean
everything else is set in stone. It only means the path to changing
other parts of the system may be less well defined. If you find
yourself wanted to frequently change a particular part of the system,
this indicates that a checklist often aided by a particular
abstraction should be created to support such flexibility.

NOTE: Checklists are up to date as of their last commit. Do not commit
changes to a checklist without ensuring its contents are still
accurate. Do not rely on any dates listed in the checklist itself. Git
is the arbiter of history, not the "last-updated" line in a text file.
